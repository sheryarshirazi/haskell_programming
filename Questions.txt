------------- Lab # 03

1.	What are the types of the following values?
a-	['a', 'b', 'c']	                               [Char]
b-	(‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’)	                               (Char, Char, Char)
c-	[(False, 'O'), (True, '1')]            [(Bool, Char)]
d-	([False, True ], ['0', '1'])	  ([Bool], [Char])
e-	[tail , init, reverse]	                 [[a] -> [a]]
2.	Consider a function saftail that behaves int the same way as tail,except that safetail maps the empty list to the empty list, whereas tail gives an error in this case. Define safetail using:
a.	A conditional expression
b.	Guarded equations
c.	Pattern Matching
3.	A triple(x,y,z) of positive integers is called Pythagorean if x2 + y2 = z2 . Define the function
4.	A positive integer is perfect if it equals the sum of all of its factors, excluding the number itself. using a list comprehension, define a function.

------------- Lab # 04

1.	The scalar product of two lists of integers xs and ys of length n is given by the sum of the products of the corresponding integers
2.	define a function that returns a bool if the list is sorted
3.	define a function that returns a bool if the number is prime
4.	now define a prime  function that  returns the list of prime numbers till the range of user entered number
5.	find the missing element in the list of first n contiguous number
6.	write a function that  discover a input character
7.	write a function that takes an integer such as 1234 and returns their ASCII code separately


------------- Lab # 05

1.	Write a function that discover if the given char is a number.
2.	Write a function that takes an integer such as 1234 and returns their ASCII Code separately.
3.	Write a function that takes date as an input and returns day of that date for any given month
4.	write a function that returns a True if number is even else False
5.	Write a function that returns a True if number is odd else False
6.	Now using above 2 functions, write a function that return list of even and odd number till that the range of user inputted number
7.	write a function that returns the position of a number in a list
8.	now modify the above function that return true if the inputted element is present in the list

------------- Lab # 06

1.	Define a function that returns a bool if the list is sorted.
2.	Define a prime function that returns the list of prime’s number till the range of user inputted number.
3.	Decide if all logical values in a list are true.
4.	Write a function that returns the position of a number in a list.
5.	Calculate Euler's totient function phi(m).
a.	Euler's totient function phi(m) is defined as the number of positive integers r (1<= r<m) that are coprime to m. Example: m=10: r=1,3,7,9; thus phi(m)=4.
b.	Note the special case : phi(1)=1.
c.	Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor equals 1.

------------- Lab # 07

1.	Decide if any logical values in a list is true.
2.	Concatenate a list of lists.
3.	Produce a list with n identical elements.
 replicate::Int -> a ->[a]
4.	Select the nth element of a list.
5.	Decide if a values is an element of a list.
6.	Define a recursive function
 merge::[int]->[int]->[int]
For example two sorted list of integer to give a single sorted list.
for Example :> merge[2,5,6][1,3,4]
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
7.	define a function isSpace that checks if given character is space or not
8.	write a function "any" that decides if at least one element of a list satisfies a given criteria

------------- Lab # 07

1.	Define a function merge sort.
2.	Write a function isSpace that accept a char and check whether it is a space.
3.	Write a function “any” that decides if at least one element of a list satisfies a given criteria, 
 many : : (a->bool) -> [a] -> Bool
4.	Use isSpace with “any” to see if a list of char has a space.
5.	Write a function that checks if a given character is alphanumeric or not.
6.	Using Foldr function: 
Define: 
•	Reverse
•	Length
•	Product by no`s.
7.	Write a function removes that remove a string from a list of strings.
